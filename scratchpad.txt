At some point in the course you may end up getting Warning: Each child in a list should have a unique "key" prop even after we add a key prop in the "Fixing a Few Warnings" lecture. To ensure that this is not an issue, we should add a type parameter to our axios config object to only search for videos and not playlists.

Update apis/youtube.js to add the type property:

    export default axios.create({
        baseURL: 'https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3',
        params: {
          part: 'snippet', 
          type: 'video',
          maxResults: 5,
          key: KEY
      }
    });
